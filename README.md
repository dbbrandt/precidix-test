# cbe-test
Cucumber-Watir Integration Testing 

## Getting up and running
    Ideally you have rvm installed and a default version of ruby setup (see below).
    Install chromedriver (ChromeDriver is a standalone server which implements WebDriver's 
    wire protocol for Chromium.) (see below) 

    git clone https://github.com/sagencelearning/cbe-test.git
    cd cbe-web
    bundle
    cp .env.sample .env
    # Edit the .env file to specify the location to put screen captures
    # export SCREENSHOT_DIR=/Users/<my-home-dir>/<projects/cbe-test>/results/screenshots
    rake tag_help
    # Pick sometag to run a test for
    rake tag_run[sometag, html]
    
    The results are put in a directory ./results with the tag and date (ex. coach4_170127.html)
     
## Installing Chromedriver

1. Goto the Chromedriver Project page (https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) 
click on the link for the latest release.  At the time of writing this, the latest version was 2.27
2. Download the chromedriver_mac64.zip
2. Unzip the package and then copy the file to /usr/bin
3. This is a hidden system folder so the easy way to get to this file is 
    - Open another finder window
    - From the Go menu select Go To Folder
    - Check echo $PATH to see if an accessible path is available to copy the file to.  
      Type /usr/local/bin and press enter
    - Now drag and drop the Chromedriver file from your Download folder to this directory. 
      Youâ€™ll be prompted for you Admin password.
5. You may need to restart your computer to get the chromedriver working

## Installing RVM
1. \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
2. rvm -v     # check version
3. rvm install  2.3.1    # install ruby which also results in Hombrew being installed.
4. In the project directory run:
   rvm use 2.3.1 --default
